## What is MaxMind SoloStack?

MaxMind SoloStack is a locally maintained database for high volume, low latency environments, a site license
allows for unlimited internal use within the purchasing organization.

Additionally, each SAPI library utilizes a tightly defined security policy, in
contrast to the typical sandboxed project, where security policies must cover the total
syscall/resource footprint of all utilized libraries.

- Includes localized names for select locations in Simplified Chinese, French, German, Japanese, Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese and Russian
- Open Source APIs are available for most popular languages
- Automated updates are available

## How does it work?

MaxMind provides both binary and CSV databases for GeoIP2. Both formats provide additional
data not available in our legacy databases including localized names for cities, subdivisions, and countries.

Binary databases make use of the MaxMind DB file format. We support the following APIs for this format for several languages, and there are many third-party APIs for languages and platforms that we do not provide support for.

The following APIs are open source and licensed under either the Apache License, Version 2.0 or Perl 5 programming language license, as indicated in the link provided.
